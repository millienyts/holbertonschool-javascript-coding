- **Versatility**: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, server-side scripting, and automation.
- **Asynchronous programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the execution of other code.
- **Rich ecosystem**: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that facilitate web development and other tasks.
